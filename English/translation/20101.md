46. 科学家们跳出来拯救它们通过使用独特的摇摆不定的证据去说明 如果鸟类不能控制昆虫，那么昆虫将会把我们吃光的影响。

47. 但是至少我们有一个接近的观点，那就是承认鸟类这个物种应该延续作为一种固有的权力，无论他们的出现和消失是否对我们有经济上的好处。

48. 出现这种情况是当生物学家不知怎么发现了关于这些生物保留着健康的捕猎规则，即只猎杀那些身体虚弱的，或者他们只猎捕那些没有价值的物种的时候。

49. 在（森林生态更加发达的）欧洲，非贸易树种被认为是当地森林界的成员那样去被合理地保护。
50. 它往往会忽略，最终消灭一些虽然在陆地生物界缺少商业价值，但是对它的健康功能运行必要的一些因素。

46.科学家们赶紧用一些很明显没有说服力的事实证据来进行挽救，这个事实就是：假如鸟类无法控制昆虫，那么昆虫就会将我们人类吃光。  
47.但是我们至少已经在逐渐承认不管鸟类相对于我们人类是否有经济价值，它 们都应该因其自身内在的权利而继续存在。  
48.曾经有段时间，生物学家或多或少滥用了一种证据，即这些生物通过杀死体 弱者来保持群的健康，或者说它们仅仅捕食没有价值的物种。  
49.在林业生态更为发达的欧洲，没有商业价值的树种被合理地看成是当地森林 群落的成员，并得到相应的保护。  
50.这个体系往往忽略，并因此最终消除陆地种群中许多物种，这些物种缺乏商 业价值，但对整个种群的健康繁衍是必不可少的。

    One basic weakness in a conservation system based wholly on economic motives is that most members of the land community have no economic value. Yet these creatures are members of the biotic community and, if its stability depends on its integrity, they are entitled to continuance. 
    When one of these noneconomic categories is threatened and, if we happen to love it, we invert excuses to give it economic importance. At the beginning of century, songbirds were supposed to be disappearing. (46) Scientists jumped to the rescue with some distinctly shaky evidence to the effect that insects would eat us up if birds failed to control them. The evidence had to be economic in order to be valid. 
    It is painful to read these round about accounts today. We have no land ethic yet, (47) but we have at least drawn nearer the point of admitting that birds should continue as a matter of intrinsic right, regardless of the presence or absence of economic advantage to us.
    A parallel situation exists in respect of predatory mammals and fish-eating birds. (48) Time was when biologists somewhat overworked the evidence that these creatures preserve the health of game by killing the physically weak, or that they prey only on “worthless” species.
    Some species of tree have been “read out of the party” by economics-minded foresters because they grow too slowly, or have too low a sale value to pay as timber crops. (49) In Europe, where forestry is ecologically more advanced, the non-commercial tree species are recognized as members of native forest community, to be preserved as such, within reason. Moreover, some have been found to have a valuable function in building up soil fertility. The interdependence of the forest and its constituent tree species, ground flora, and fauna is taken for granted.
    To sum up: a system of conservation based solely on economic self-interest is hopelessly lopsided. (50) It tends to ignore, and thus eventually to eliminate, many elements in the land community that lack commercial value, but that are essential to its healthy functioning. It assumes, falsely, I think, that the economic parts of the biotic clock will function without the uneconomic parts.
